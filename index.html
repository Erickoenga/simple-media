<h1>Simple- Media for Lions</h1>
    <p>They are considered to be the stongest animals in the wildlife family. Lions, for a long time have mantained their position in the animal government by being brave and kings of the jungle. It is incredible how they have managed to do it. <br>
    This calls self confidence. Despite the fact that lions are the kings of the jungle, they also die and sometimes killed by other animals if they misbehave. The world has changed and anything can happen to a lion.</p>

    <h3>Are lions going to mantain their positions?</h3>
    Great animals are coming up that are powerful and brave as lions. My worry is are lions going to keep their legacy as kings of the jungle?<br>
